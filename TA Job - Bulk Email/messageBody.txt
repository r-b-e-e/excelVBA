I would like to express my interest in obtaining a Teaching Assistant position for the course, if available. I feel that with my 2.5 years of work experience as an Software Developer and my academic experience, I have all of the qualities to work as a Teaching Assistant. Also, currently I am working as a Teaching Assistant under Dr. Jamie Payton for the course “Software Development Projects” which gave me a good exposure on being a Teaching Assistant. I can assure you that if given this opportunity, I would add value as a faculty under CCI department. I have attached my resume for your reference. I would very much like an opportunity to meet with you personally to discuss my candidacy further. Thank you.

Have a nice day!!

Warm Regards,
